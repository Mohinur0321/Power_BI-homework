In desktop we can build and design locally, while on Service we share, refresh, view, and manager reports

There is publish button in the files, and from there we should choose select workspace

It is an environment to share and manage together for the teamwork, but also can be used individually


Workspace allows users to create and edit dashboards while app is only for reading and also sharing with others

It is model of datasets used for reports (relationships, tables, measures) that power bi stores in cloud

Scheduled Refresh automatically updates your dataset at specific times by re-querying the connected data source.


A dataset is the imported or connected data model used by reports.
A dataflow is an online ETL process that prepares and stores cleaned data in the cloud for reuse by multiple datasets.

users should use dataflow when they want to reuse the datasteps across reports

they differ in their view and page limit

12 When right clicking the visual there is icon of pin there. Users should use that icon

13 Mobile view is very useful for those who are always on the go. They can share, view, and do many things with the dashboard  in their mobile devices without need of laptop

15. Yes through export button in files

16 Live Connection means that your Power BI report is connected directly to a data source (like an Analysis Services model, Power BI dataset, or Azure Analysis Services) without importing data.
Instead of storing data in Power BI, it queries the source in real time.
17Row-Level Security (RLS) is a feature that restricts data access for users at the row level based on roles and filters.
